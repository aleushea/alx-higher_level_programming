	All my test files are inside a folder tests
	my file organization in the tests folder should be the same as my project: ex: for models/base.py, 
	unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/t    est_base.py
	All my tests are to be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
	I can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py
	Its strongly encouraged to work together on test cases so that I donâ€™t miss any edge case
